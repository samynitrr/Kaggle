# Kaggle Competitions
This is my first entry into the world of AI/ML Learning. 
This is the first attempt via the famous Titanic dataset.

# Evaluation Metrics
```bash
Goal
It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.
For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

Metric
Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.

Submission File Format
You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.

The file should have exactly 2 columns:

PassengerId (sorted in any order)
Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)

```
